The United Nations regularly produce [population estimates](http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm) by country

I have taken their median estimates for the future along with data from 1950
onwards to construct some maps, charts and tables which I hope will prove informative
The data is based on 2012 , contemporary boundaries and excludes some of smallest territories
